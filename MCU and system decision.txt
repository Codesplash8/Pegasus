Overview of the main system direction and parts
-------------------------------------------------


System consists of one main board which is connected to a screen for setting values on-the-fly and show data.
Main board can connect to other boards in the future using CAN bus.

Main board needs to have:
- Digital and analog I/O for discrete signals (12V signals)
- CAN bus transciever
- Way of connecting to a screen (decide on screen to be used)
- I2C and UART expansion possibility
- Fast MCU that can multitask (Fast single core threading is acceptable)
- Possible to obtain during the chip shortage
- MCU needs to be cheap-ish
- Bonus: Bluetooth or LTE expansion possibilities


MCU's to consider:

- ATSAM E70 (Microchip)
	* Has CAN integrated, High Speed USB, Ethernet
	* Extremely fast (Arm Cortex-M7 300MHz) 
	* Uart, Spi, i2c++
	* Lots of ADC and DAC options
	* ~10$ each, so not that expensive
- ATSAM E5x (Microchip) 
	* Comparable to E70, but runs at 120MHz, less ram and such
	* A little less powerful, but could be a good option
- PIC32 MZ
	* Has integrated graphgics controller (GPU) up to WVGA 800x400
	* Has integrated CAN, USB
	* Up to 2MB Live update flash, 32MB DDR2 SDRAM, 640KB SRAM
	* 200MHz core
	* Built in Crypto engine, 4x 32-bit counters, 9x 16-bit counters
	* Up to 45 analog inputs!
	* Cost: ~15$
